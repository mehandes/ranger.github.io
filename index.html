<h2>Description</h2>

<p>
  ranger is a file manager with VI key bindings.  It provides a minimalistic and
  nice curses interface with a view on the directory hierarchy.  The secondary
  task of ranger is to psychically guess which program you want to use for
  opening particular files.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Uses <a href="http://python.org">Python</a> (2.6 or higher)</li>
